            <h2>Typesetting</h2>
            <p>Typesetting involves manual arranging of letters and symbols in a press.
                This method required concentration as each piece of type has to be placed in the correct order to
                form words and sentences.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>Desktop pubishing</h2>
        <p>This service is a critical element in a translation project, especially for larger scale projects. </p>
        <section>
            <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), HTML gives the structure while CSS
                gives presentation.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>Comparision Typesetting is a traditional print method, while desktop publishing and web technologies
            like HTML and CSS offer greater flexibility and efficiency.
            Desktop publishing enables quick changes and multimedia integration, whereas HTML and CSS provide an
            experience that typesetting lacks. </h2>
