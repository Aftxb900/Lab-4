    <section id="1">
        <h1>Emphasis and strengthened text</h1>
        <p>This is an example where we have <em>emphasized</em> words and made others <strong>strong</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="2">
        <h2>Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Using `<em>` and `<strong>` tags is a better choice than `<i>` and `<b>` tags because they provide a meaning to the text. The `<em>` tag indicates that the text is useful for screen readers, while the `<strong>` tag shows that the text has strong importance. 
           This improves accessibility and helps search engines understand the content's context better, whereas `<i>` and `<b>` only change the visual presentation without conveying any meaning.</p>
