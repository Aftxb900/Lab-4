        <h1>Difference between Google Doc and HTML</h1>
        <p>Google Docs has a user-friendly interface with formatting options that are easily available in the toolbar.
            HTML documents require manual coding to format and using tags to define structure and presentation.
            Google Docs is great for collaboration, allowing multiple users to edit and comment. HTML while they can be
            shared but they
            require additional tools to collaborative.
            Articles created in Google Docs can be easily shared and published with just a share option while HTML need
            to be run on a web
            server and should web host to make it public.
            HTML has flexibility and customization options, giving options to do advanced styling and scripting through
            CSS and JavaScript.
            Google Docs is versatile and has limits in terms of custom design and functions.</p>
